                    <h1>Compressibility</h1>
                    <p>Definition: The compressibility factor, denoted as Z, is a measure used to describe how gasses deviate from ideal behavior. It is the ratio of the molar volume of a real gas to the molar volume predicted by the ideal gas law under the same temperature and pressure conditions. For an ideal gas, Z would be equal to 1, but in real gasses, factors such as intermolecular forces and molecular size can cause deviations from ideality. The compressibility factor is valuable in understanding and predicting the behavior of gasses in various industrial and scientific applications, helping researchers and engineers account for non-ideal characteristics when working with real-world gas systems.</p>
                    <div>
                    <p>Formula: Z = PV/nRT</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>Units: Unitless</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>Uses:  It serves as a key tool for scientists and engineers in various applications, particularly in the design and operation of gas-related processes. By quantifying how gasses deviate from ideal behavior under specific temperature and pressure conditions, Z aids in the accurate prediction of gas properties. Industries, including petrochemical and manufacturing, rely on the compressibility factor to optimize processes involving real gasses, ensuring efficiency and reliability in operations. In scientific research, Z contributes to a deeper understanding of gas behavior, enhancing the precision of experiments and modeling in fields such as chemistry, physics, and materials science.</p>
