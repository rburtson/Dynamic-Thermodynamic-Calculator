                  <h1>Q - Heat</h1>
                  <p>Definition: Heat is a form of energy transfer between systems or regions that differ in temperature. Heat can be exchanged through conduction, convection, or radiation, and its measurement is integral to the study of thermodynamic processes. The transfer of heat plays a key role in determining temperature changes, phase transitions, and the overall energy balance of a system. From the design of engines to the analysis of climate patterns, the study of heat is foundational in comprehending the behavior of matter and energy in diverse scientific and engineering applications within the field of thermodynamics.</p>
                  <p>Formula: there is no specific formula for heat, must be obtained per system from the overall energy balance</p>
                  <p>Units: all forms of energy (J, kJ, etc)</p>
                  <p>Example: Engines with the sole purpose of creating heat (heat pumps to warm pools), ovens</p>
              </div>
              <div class="column">
                <h1>W - Work</h1>
                <p>Definition: Work is a crucial concept representing the energy transfer associated with mechanical processes. It is defined as the force applied to a system multiplied by the distance over which the force is applied. Work can be done on a system, causing an increase in its internal energy, or by a system, leading to a decrease in internal energy. Understanding work is essential for analyzing and designing various processes, including those in engines, refrigeration systems, and industrial applications. In thermodynamic equations, work is often a key component, providing insights into the energy transformations occurring within a system and influencing the overall efficiency of energy conversion processes.</p>
                <p>Formula: There is no specific formula for work, it must be obtained from the overall energy balance of the system</p>
                <p>Units: All forms of energy (J, kJ, etc). N*m is also valid, however, discouraged to avoid confusion with torque.</p>
                <p>Types of work:<div></div> 
                  Shaft work: work of the rotation of a shaft within the system
                  <div></div>
                  Electric work: work of an electrical component within the system
                  <div></div>
                  Pressure-volume work: work of the changing of pressure and volume within a system
