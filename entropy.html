                Description: Entropy is often defined as the “randomness” or “disorder” of systems as its value if often tied to the amount of states that the system is able to be in at a given moment in time. When viewing the universe itself as a system we can see that the entropy always increases for all possible thermodynamic processes. Entropy governs the flow of energy of a system, it is the reason heat does spontaneously go from cold temperatures to hot ones.
              </div>
              <div style="padding: 20px">
                Use: The entropy of a system is often studied to understand where the energy of a process is going. While many thermodynamic systems are viewed under the lens of “reversibility” which states that the entropy of a system does not change with the process, this assumption is always incorrect because the entropy of the universe always needs to increase. Entropy, like energy, has its own balance which has different conditions, the entropy change needs to be positive or 0. Without the entropy balance the energy balance would be evaluated with a process that could never happen, this state function is so important that it is its own law of thermodynamics which can be read about in the other sections.
